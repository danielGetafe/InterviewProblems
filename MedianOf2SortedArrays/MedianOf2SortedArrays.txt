Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively,
return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Solution algorithm:
1- Merge the 2 arrays until the length of the new arrays is egual to
(n+m)/2 or (n+m)/2 + 1 depends if that length is an odd or even number
2- return the last number or the add of the last 2 numbers divded by 2
